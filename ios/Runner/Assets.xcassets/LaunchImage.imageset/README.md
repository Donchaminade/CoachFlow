# CoachFlow Launch Screen Assets

> **Branding Note:** This launch screen is the user's first interaction with CoachFlow. It must reflect our **"Premium Minimalist"** identity.

## Guidelines

1.  **Background**: Should be pure black (`#000000`) for OLED efficiency and premium feel on mobile.
2.  **Logo**: The central logo should be the high-resolution "Brain" icon 🧠 centered.
3.  **Typography**: No text is preferred on the launch screen to handle all localizations gracefully. If text is strictly necessary (e.g., copyright), use `Poppins` font.

## Updating Assets

You can customize the launch screen with your own desired assets by replacing the image files in this directory.

You can also do it by opening your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, selecting `Runner/Assets.xcassets` in the Project Navigator and dropping in the desired images.
